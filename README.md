# JimmyDeploy

JimmyDeploy is a standalone application that helps in setting up new Windows installations.

## Usage

JimmyDeploy is a standalone application that requires no installation.

A config file must be loaded for JimmyDeploy to operate. Documentation for creating a config file can be found here. By default when it is run it will by look for a JimmyDeploy.json file to load in the apps starting directory. If not found, it will ask for you to locate a configuration to load.

JimmyDeploy will ask for any additional details such as Domain Admin credentials and allows you to select commands that you do not want to run. It will run automatically, and give a prompt once finished.
