# JimmyDeploy
An app that configures Windows post-install

## But Why?
Before you ask, yes I could of setup Windows Deployment Services + Microsoft Deployment Toolkit and done some sweet PXE network boot stuff. However because I'm a Software Engineering student, keeping that stuff maintained takes time and that requires me to setup yet another Windows Server VM, I decided to write an app that helps me automate the process of reimaging/provisioning computers.
